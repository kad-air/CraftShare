# Privacy Policy for CraftShare

**Last Updated:** January 9, 2026

## Overview
CraftShare ("we", "us", or "our") respects your privacy. This policy explains how our iOS application handles your data.

**In short:** We do not track you. We do not sell your data. Your data is processed only when you explicitly share it, using services you configure yourself.

## 1. Data We Collect & Process

### A. Content You Share
When you use the Share Extension to save a webpage, the app accesses:
- The URL of the webpage.
- The title and textual content of the webpage.
- Metadata (such as images) associated with the page.

### B. API Keys & Credentials
You input your own API credentials for third-party services:
- **Craft Docs Access Token & Space ID**
- **Google Gemini API Key**

These credentials are stored **securely on your device** using the iOS Keychain and/or encrypted User Defaults. We (the app developers) never see, receive, or store these keys.

## 2. How Your Data Is Used

### A. AI Processing (Google Gemini)
To structure the data from the webpages you share, the content (URL and text) is sent directly from your device to the **Google Gemini API** using the API Key you provided.
- Please refer to [Google's Generative AI Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) for details on how they handle API data.

### B. Saving to Craft
The processed data is sent directly from your device to the **Craft Docs API** to create documents in your specified Space.
- Please refer to [Craft's Privacy Policy](https://www.craft.do/privacy) for details on how they handle your document data.

## 3. Third-Party Services
This app acts as a bridge between your device and these third-party services. We do not operate our own servers or collect analytics. Data transmission occurs directly between your device and:
1.  **Google (Gemini API)**
2.  **Craft (Craft Docs API)**

## 4. Analytics & Tracking
We do **not** use any third-party analytics (like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.) or crash reporting tools that track your identity or usage behavior.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you through the app or the App Store listing.
